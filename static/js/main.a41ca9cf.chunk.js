This shows how the imports and dependencies on other countries for technology affects south africa. This is essentially techno-colonialism. Because we consume foreign technology and foreign content. This grey colour symbolizes how africa at the current moment in time is dependent and effected by the views of the colonisers and the global north. They are looked down upon and live in the shadow of the global north. This view of the African continent is due to decades of colonial activity and exploitation that has been imposed upon africa. This has led the global north to both think that they are better than the global south and believe that only their views matter. A current example of this is the way that the US, UK, and EU have restricted travel to south africa, in the light of the discovery of the omnicron variant of the covid-19 virus that was discovered by south africa. This was possible because of South Africa\u2019s technological advancement which has allowed more in-depth study and investigation of the covid-19 virus. This barring of travel was done even though the variant was present in the population of these global northern societies before it was in South Africa. This shows how africa falls victim to the historical and stereotypical views of being less important than the global north. This brings me to my most pivotal meaning of my work. The power of technological advancement. when the \u201ctechnology out of africa\u201d button is pressed the continent lights up, in a brilliant neon green colour. This colour was used to symbolize the intense growth and view change that africa would go through if it were to become producers of technology and be at the global forefront of technological advancement. This would not only change the way that the global north views Africa, but it would further uplift the continent by creating jobs, and new areas of employment. This is what the arrows that appear on the sides of the image of Africa symbolize. The fact that technology has the power to challenge and change the discourses of centuries of colonialism through upliftment. This would not only place a higher global importance and attention on the continent as a whole, but also create an environment where africa focuses on itself instead of the global north.

The rich spend wealth on ridiculous non-physical objects just because they can. I believe that this digital artwork shows the falsity and shallow nature of competitive capitalism. This is because after the person sold the NFT to himself the price and value of all NFT\u2019s in the collection went up in value.

This was a technical challenge for me to learn a new framework. For the second assignment, I wanted to add a little more complexity to the site while trying to keep the UI as simple and intuitive as possible. Therefore, I have instead opted to use background images for my main pages (homepage, internet art page, and blog page), these images aid in better contextualizing and aid in giving off the meaning that my site is about. For the homepage I wanted it to give off the idea that the site deals with concepts that are present and relevant in our modern-day societies, this is why I have used a neon image of a city to show this. This page is the first thing that viewers see of the sight, and I wanted it to be captivating and interesting. To do this I have added large welcome text and smaller text that is distinctly separated from the colourful background. This text aims to contextualize my site for the user and provide information about the website itself. The three large images that are centred on the page act as an image menu and are made to draw attention and give off ideas of what the site is about.
